        "**Answer:**\n",
        "Both Best-First Search and Beam Search are heuristic-based informed search techniques. Best-First Search expands nodes by selecting the node with the lowest heuristic value from the entire open list. Its main drawback is **exponential space complexity (O(bᵈ))**, as it stores all generated nodes.\n",
        "\n",
        "Beam Search solves this limitation by introducing a **beam width (K)**, which restricts the number of nodes retained for future expansion. At every level, only the best K nodes (with lowest heuristic values) are kept, and all others are pruned. This reduces space complexity to **O(K·d)**. However, due to pruning, Beam Search becomes **incomplete and non-optimal**.\n",
