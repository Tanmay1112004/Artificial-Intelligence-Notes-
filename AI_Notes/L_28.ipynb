        "\n",
        "**Answer:**\n",
        "Traditional computers operate using predefined rules and explicit programming. They are efficient for exact computations but fail in tasks requiring learning and adaptation. For example, in facial recognition, a traditional system cannot recognize a person if their appearance changes unless every variation is explicitly programmed.\n",
        "\n",
        "Artificial Neural Networks, on the other hand, learn from training data by adjusting internal weights. Once trained, they can generalize and recognize patterns even with variations, achieving high accuracy. This makes ANNs suitable for complex pattern recognition problems.\n",

        "An artificial neuron consists of inputs, weights, a summation function, an activation function, and an output. Inputs represent incoming signals, while weights indicate the importance of each input. The weighted sum is processed through an activation function to produce the output.\n",
        "\n",
        "Weights play a crucial role as they control the influence of each input. During learning, weights are adjusted to minimize error, making the neural network more accurate over time.\n",
