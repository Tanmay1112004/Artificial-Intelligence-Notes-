        "A* Search is one of the most powerful and widely-used **Informed Search** algorithms in Artificial Intelligence. It smartly combines the actual cost taken so far with a heuristic estimate of the remaining cost. Because of this, A* is both **complete** and **optimal**, making it a gold standard for pathfinding tasks.\n",

        "* A* belongs to **Informed/Heuristic Search** because it uses additional knowledge (a heuristic) to guide the search.\n",
        "* Unlike Blind Searches (BFS, DFS), A* actively considers how close you are to the goal.\n",
