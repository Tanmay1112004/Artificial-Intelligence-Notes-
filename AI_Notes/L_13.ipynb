        "   It is a point higher than all its immediate neighbors but lower than the global maximum.\n",

        "   It is a region where all neighboring states have the same heuristic value.\n",

        "   Occurs when the global optimal path is narrow and requires diagonal movement.\n",
        "   Hill Climbing moves in single directions only, so it fails to ascend the ridge and gets stuck on the sides.\n",
