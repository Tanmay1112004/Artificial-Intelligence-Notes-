        "## **Q1. How does IDDFS achieve both optimality and completeness while keeping memory low?**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Answer:**\n",
        "IDDFS achieves optimality and completeness because it explores the search tree **level-by-level**, just like BFS. It starts with depth limit L=0, then L=1, then L=2, and so on.\n",
        "Since it explores all nodes at depth *d* before moving to depth *d+1*, the first time it finds the goal, it must be at the **shallowest possible depth**, making it **optimal**.\n",
        "\n",
        "IDDFS also ensures **completeness**, because it never gets stuck in infinite paths. Every iteration increases the limit, guaranteeing that all levels will eventually be searched.\n",
        "\n",
        "Even though it searches multiple times, each iteration is a **Depth-Limited DFS**, which only stores nodes along the current path in a stack.\n",
        "Thus, IDDFS uses **O(b·d)** space, which is extremely low and comparable to DFS.\n",

        "## **Q2. What is the main drawback of IDDFS, and why is it still preferred over BFS?**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Answer:**\n",
        "The main drawback of IDDFS is **repetition of work**.\n",
        "Nodes near the root are explored again and again in each iteration (for L=0, 1, 2, …), which increases time.\n",
        "\n",
        "But this drawback is considered acceptable because:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Shallow nodes are very few**, so rechecking them barely affects total cost.\n",
        "2. In a search tree, the number of nodes at the deepest level is so large that time wasted in re-exploring shallow levels becomes insignificant.\n",
        "3. IDDFS avoids the main weakness of BFS:\n",
        "   → Extremely high space complexity **O(b^d)**\n",
        "   IDDFS uses only **O(b·d)** space, which is dramatically more efficient.\n",
        "\n",
        "Hence, IDDFS is preferred when memory is limited or when the depth of the solution is unknown.\n",
