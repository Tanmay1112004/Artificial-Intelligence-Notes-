        "**Answer:**\n",
        "The 8-Puzzle is a 3×3 grid containing eight numbered tiles and one blank space. The objective is to transform a given Start State into a predefined Goal State by sliding tiles into the blank position. Each configuration of the puzzle represents a **state** in the state-space.\n",
