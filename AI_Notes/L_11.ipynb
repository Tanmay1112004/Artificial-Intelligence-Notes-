        "Best-First Search (BeFS) is an **Informed / Heuristic Search** technique that uses a **heuristic function, h(n)**, to decide which node to explore next. Unlike BFS or DFS (which search blindly), BeFS always chooses the node that seems **closest to the goal** based on the **minimum heuristic value**.\n",
        "\n",
        "It uses a **Priority Queue** to store frontier nodes (OPEN list) and always expands the node with the lowest *h(n)*. A CLOSED list prevents revisiting old nodes.\n",
        "\n",
        "BeFS is faster than uninformed search because it is **Greedy**, but this greediness makes it **non-optimal**. It may find a good path but not necessarily the shortest one.\n",
