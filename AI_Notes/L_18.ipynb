        "### **Answer:**\n",
        "\n",
        "The Minimax algorithm is used to determine the optimal move in a two-player, zero-sum game by exploring the entire game tree. It assumes that both players act rationally and play optimally.\n",
        "\n",
        "The process begins with evaluating all terminal states (leaf nodes), where a numerical utility value such as +1, 0, or –1 is assigned. From these leaf nodes, the algorithm performs *backtracking* to propagate values upward.\n",
        "\n",
        "At every **MAX node**, the player aims to maximize the utility value and therefore selects the highest value among its children.\n",
        "At every **MIN node**, the opponent tries to minimize MAX’s score and chooses the smallest value among its children.\n",
        "\n",
        "This alternating selection of maximum and minimum continues until the root node is reached. The final value at the root node indicates the best outcome MAX can guarantee. The branch corresponding to this root value represents the optimal move.\n",

        "### **Answer:**\n",
        "\n",
        "The time complexity of the Minimax algorithm is (O(b^d)), where (b) is the branching factor and (d) is the depth of the game tree. This exponential complexity means computation grows explosively with even small increases in (b) or (d).\n",
        "\n",
        "For complex games such as Chess, where the branching factor is about 35 and the game depth may reach 100 plies, the total number of possibilities becomes too large ((35^{100})). Traversing this complete game tree is computationally infeasible.\n",
        "\n",
        "To address this issue, **Alpha-Beta Pruning** is used. It improves Minimax by pruning branches that cannot possibly affect the final decision. This reduces the effective search space dramatically while still guaranteeing the same optimal move. As a result, deeper levels of the tree can be explored within the same computation time.\n",
