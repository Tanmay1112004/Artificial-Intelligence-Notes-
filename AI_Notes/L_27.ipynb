        "\n",
        "**Answer:**\n",
        "Boolean Logic operates using crisp values (0 or 1) and cannot represent uncertainty or gradual transitions. In real-world systems, such as autonomous vehicles, this causes instability when inputs fluctuate near decision boundaries. Fuzzy Logic overcomes this limitation by introducing membership functions that allow partial truth values between 0 and 1, enabling smooth and realistic decision-making.\n",

It allows a value to partially belong to multiple categories, enabling fuzzy logic systems to handle uncertainty and represent real-world continuous data effectively.\n",
