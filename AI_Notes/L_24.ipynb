        "* It depends **only on the current percept**.\n",

        "* In real life, environments are rarely fully observable.\n",
        "* Example:\n",
        "  A self-driving car can’t see cars behind it or remember braking done 30 seconds ago.\n",
        "* So MBRA uses a **model (internal state)** to represent the parts of the world it cannot directly perceive.\n",

        "## **Q1. Why is a Simple Reflex Agent inadequate for partially observable environments, and how does the MBRA address this?**\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Answer:**\n",
        "\n",
        "A **Simple Reflex Agent** relies only on the current percept.\n",
        "In a **partially observable environment**, the percept does not contain full information.\n",
        "Different world states may produce the **same percept**, causing wrong decisions.\n",

        "Example:\n",
        "Two road situations may look identical now, but differ based on events that happened seconds ago.\n",
        "\n",
        "The **Model-Based Reflex Agent** solves this by:\n",
        "\n",
        "* Maintaining an **internal model** that stores unobserved information.\n",
        "* Using the knowledge of **how the world evolves** to track past actions.\n",

        "* Stores a historical record of the environment.\n",
        "* Helps predict future states.\n",
